 What is cloud computing
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">

- on demand delivery of computer power, database storage, applications and other IT resources<br>
- pay-as-you-go pricing<br>
- instant access to resources instantly of any size <br>

<h5> Types of clouds</h5>

<h6> Private</h6>
- cloud services used by single organisations, not exposed to the public<br>
- complete control<br>
- e.g. Rackspace<br>

<h6> Public</h6>
- cloud services owned and operated by third-party providers, delivered over the internet<br>
- e.g. AWS, Azure<br>

<h5> Five characteristics of cloud computing</h5>
- on-demand self-service - *can provision resources without human interaction*<br>
- broad network access - *resources available over network, accessed by diverse client platforms*<br>
- multi-tenancy and resource pooling - *multiple clients can share same infra*<br>
- rapid elasticity and scalibility<br>
- measured service - users pay correctly for what they use<br>

<h5> Six advantages</h5>
- trade capItal expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)<br>
    - pay on-demand, reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) and operational expense (OPEX)
- benefit from massive economies of scale - prices are more efficient due to large scale<br>
- stop guessing capacity - scale based on actual usage<br>
- increased speed and agility - due to on-demand<br>
- stop spending money, running and maintaing data centers<br>
- allows us to go global<br>

<h5> Problems solved by the cloud</h5>
- flexibility<br>
- cost-effective<br>
- scalability<br>
- elasticity<br>

<h5> Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</h5>
- provide building blocks for cloud IT<br>
- provides networking, computers and data storage<br>
- highest level of flexibility<br>
- easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT<br>
- example of cloud computing types: AWS EC2<br>
    
<h5> platform as a service</h5>
- removes need for your org to manage underlying infra<br>
- focus and dev and management  <br>
- example of cloud computing types: AWS Elastic Beanstalk<br>
    
<h5> software as a service</h5>
- completed product that is run and managed by the service provider<br>
- example of cloud computing types: Machine learning<br>

<h5> Pricing of the cloud</h5>

3 pricing fundamentals<br>
- compute - pay for compute time<br>
- storage - pay for amount of data stored<br>
- data transfer out<br>
    - only pay when data leaves the cloud
    - data in is free
