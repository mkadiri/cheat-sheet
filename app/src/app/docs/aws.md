# AWS certification

## Roadmap for professional DevOps certification
1. Foundational - AWS cloud practitioner
2. Associate - AWS SysOps administrator/AWS developer
3. Professional - AWS DevOps engineer

## What is cloud computing
- on demand delivery of computer power, database storage, applications and other IT resources
- pay-as-you-go pricing
- instant access to resources instantly of any size 

### Types of clouds

#### Private
- cloud services used by single organisations, not exposed to the public
- complete control
- e.g. Rackspace

#### Public
- cloud services owned and operated by third-party providers, delivered over the internet
- e.g. AWS, Azure


### Five characteristics of cloud computing
- on-demand self service - *can provision resources without human interaction*
- broad network access - *resources available over network, accessed by diverse client platforms*
- multi-tenancy and resource pooling - *multiple clients can share same infra*
- rapid elasticity and scalibility
- measured service - users pay correctly for what they use

### Six advantages
- trade capItal expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
    - pay on-demand, reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) and operational expense (OPEX)
- benefit from massive economies of scale - prices are more efficient due to large scale
- stop guessing capacity - scale based on actual usage
- increased speed and agility - due to on-demand
- stop spending money, running and maintaing data centers
- allows us to go global

### Problems solved by the cloud
- flexibility
- cost-effective
- scalability
- elasticity

## Types of cloud computing

### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- provide building blocks for cloud IT
- provides networking, computers and data storage
- highest level of flexibility
- easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
- example of cloud computing types: AWS EC2
    
### platform as a service
- removes need for your org to manage underlying infra
- focus and dev and management  
- example of cloud computing types: AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    
### software as a service
- completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
- example of cloud computing types: Machine learning

### Pricing of the cloud
3 pricing fundamentals
- compute - pay for compute time
- storage - pay for amount of data stored
- data transfer out
    - only pay when data leaves the cloud
    - data in is free

### How to choose a region

- compliance with governance and legal requirements
